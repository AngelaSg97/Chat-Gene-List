🧬 Gene List Analyzer (Chat with Gene List)This is a bioinformatics assistant based on Streamlit that leverages the Gemini 2.5 Flash model to analyze lists of gene symbols and return structured information in a tabular format, ready for CSV export. It includes external validation against NCBI APIs to ensure gene symbol accuracy.✨ Key FeaturesStructured LLM Analysis: Uses the gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025 model to extract specific data (e.g., full name, function, diseases) from gene lists, ensuring the output is exclusively in JSON format for easy processing.Hybrid Validation: Converts the JSON response into a pandas DataFrame and adds an external validation step against NCBI E-utilities to confirm the existence and full name of each gene.Dynamic and Flexible Prompting: Users can customize the AI query, deciding which data columns they want to extract (e.g., Ensembl ID, Chromosome, Function).Robustness and Stability: Both Gemini and NCBI calls implement an Exponential Backoff logic to automatically handle rate limits and ensure application stability.Containerization for Reproducibility: Uses Docker and Docker Compose for an isolated, consistent, and reproducible execution environment.🛠️ PrerequisitesTo run the application locally, you need the following:Docker Desktop (includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose).A Google Gemini API Key.🔑 API ConfigurationThe application requires authentication via the Gemini API key.Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project.Add your API key to the .env file in the following format:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
Note: The .env file is referenced in docker-compose.yml and ensures your API key is managed securely and separate from the source code.🚀 Installation and StartupFollow these steps to start the application locally using Docker Compose.1. Clone the Repository (or navigate to the project directory):cd /path/to/your/project
2. Start the Application:The up --build command will build the Docker image (based on the Dockerfile), create the container, and start it. The process includes installing the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.docker compose up --build
3. Access the Interface:Once the logs indicate that Streamlit is running, open your browser and navigate to:http://localhost:8501
Technical Detail: Streamlit's default port is 8501.👨‍💻 Usage InstructionsThe Streamlit interface guides the user through three simple phases:Enter Genes (Section 1): Paste a list of gene symbols. The system accepts genes separated by commas, spaces, or new lines.Define the Query (Section 2): Modify the default instruction to specify exactly which tabular fields you want the AI to return (e.g., "Provide Ensembl ID and Disease Association").Analyze: Click the 🚀 Analyze Genes with Gemini button.The results will be shown in an interactive table:Rows with NCBI validation issues will be highlighted in red.You can download the complete table in CSV format for further analysis.⚙️ Project Structure.
